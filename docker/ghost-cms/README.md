# Ghost CMS Docker Stack
This stack will help with starting your own Ghost CMS container in docker. This stack comes with MySQL configured to work with the Ghost container. There is the option to use Ghost without MySQL and use MySQLite instead. Use MySQLite if you do not expect a lot of traffic to your website and want something that is simpler to manage.

## Environment Variables
To further configure your Ghost CMS, check out the [Configuration options](https://ghost.org/docs/config/#configuration-options) from the Ghost developer docs.
